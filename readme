# JS event handlers works in very strange way.

in total js event hadlers has 3 steps

1. Event Capturing 
2. Target capture
3. Bubbling  => Event ocuurs

Lets consider 3 elements A,B,C 
A is the biggest container, B is little less than A and C is smallest one, nesting on top of each other.
now lets attach event handlers to all of them.
now when we touch the element C, we are technically touching A and B too, but the event should first trigger at C, right?
and hence JS Engine triggers the event in Bubbling phase.
